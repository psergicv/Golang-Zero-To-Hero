# Golang Zero To Hero

Welcome to Golang Zero To Hero! This repository is a testament to my personal journey learning Golang. As I progress from a beginner to an expert, I'll share scripts I create along the way. The repository is divided into *Beginner*, *Advanced*, and *Expert* sections, mirroring my evolving understanding of the language. Whether you're here to learn alongside me, or simply to explore, you're welcome to use these scripts as a resource. Let's embark on this journey from zero to hero in Golang together!

## Getting Started

Before you can use these scripts, ensure that you have Go installed on your system. The installation guide is available on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Running Scripts

Once Go is installed, you can navigate to the script you wish to run in the respective *Beginner*, *Advanced*, or *Expert* folder. To execute the script, you will use the `go run` command in your terminal, followed by the name of your Go script.

## Contribute

I always welcome contributions. Feel free to suggest improvements, offer feedback or add new scripts to the appropriate difficulty level. 

Embark on your journey from zero to hero with Go!
